        <p>The goals for the second major release of Smart IT were to translate the experience to native mobile apps and expand Smart IT for Knowledge workers and Change Managers.</p>
        <p>I conducted user research studies to develop our understanding of these new personas and led the interaction design for the four new platforms (iPhone, iPad, Android Phone, Android Tablet). The final product has been praised for its support of Knowledge-Centered Support (KCS) principles and the ease of editing knowledge articles.</p>

  <h2>Redesigning for Mobile</h2>
  <p>Rather than starting from the lowest common denominator platform (Phone) for Smart IT 1.0, we attempted to adapt the Universal Client (Desktop/Web) to the tablet form factor. This had some unfortunate consequences. Some of the Desktop/Web patterns were stretch fits for tablet and clashed with Apple's iOS Human Interface Guidelines, such as a grid component for the Ticket Console. Code reuse possibilities between tablet and smartphone were stymied by this approach, as many custom components had to be written for the tablet experience. And as we later found out from anecdotal and market research statistics, many more companies were interested in leveraging their employee's smartphones than buying them tablets. We needed to rethink our approach.</p>
  <p>We already had made a start to the smartphone designs but many design decisions simply had to be rethought. Working with another interaction designer on our Smart IT team, I drafted a new set of smartphone mockups and identified changes to make to the tablet experience so that the two could better match. We simplified the design to a drill-down navigation stack pattern and attempted to focus on just one action per view. Edit forms were moved to modals and two-column layouts were eschewed in favor of view switchers. All designs were created in Adobe Illustrator and uploaded as individual screens to InVision, where they could be displayed within iPhone and Android phone shells and stitched together into real flows with animated transitions in between. We used InVision for user testing as well with a select set of customer companies keen on mobilizing their workforces with mobile technology.</p>
  <p>One boon to our mobile design work was the establishment of mobile pattern libraries within Adobe Creative Cloud. These cloud libraries allowed us to build reusable stencils adhering to the iOS and Android interface guidelines. Dragging stencil artwork from the library palette onto Illustrator artboards made it possible to prototype entire flows in minutes! The efficiency gains were incredible.</p>
