  <h3>Codifying the BMC Smart App</h3>
  <p>
    While at BMC, I was fortunate to launch <a href="/works/smart_it" class="underline">Smart IT</a>, a rethinking of the IT Service Desk that raised expectations for enterprise IT apps. This put pressure on BMC to deliver an environment in which customers could build and configure apps with the design language, mobile support, and capabilities of Smart IT. To address this need, we began a project called Innovation Suite.
  </p>
  <p>
    My first challenge was to look at what we had done with Smart IT and extract the patterns and principles for what made it tick. I did this by creating Strawman, a reference app consisting of templates and configurable components.
  </p>
  <p>
    I took every major flow and page layout from Smart IT and broke them down into building blocks, thinking about reusability, communication between components, and key configurable properties. I also looked at other enterprise IT apps from BMC and other companies to determine the smallest set of components to build the widest set of apps.

  <h3>Designing for Business Analysts</h3>
  <p>
    Drawing from user research, we established five user personas. The two in focus for the first release of Innovation Suite were Seth the Developer and Ajay the Business Analyst.
  </p>
  <p>
    The business analyst gathers project requirements for new apps and changes to existing apps that might be made using Innovation Suite. We determined that this person should not be expected to have deep technical knowledge like a programmer might. Matching the less engineering-focused tools this person uses—spreadsheets, flow diagrams, and project presentations—would be key.

  <h3>Prototyping the View Designer</h3>
  <p>
    Innovation Suite already had a series of “designers” to define database fields, set business rules, and manage security. But these editors assumed a moderate level of technical knowledge and were not designed for business analysts. I spent several months establishing the View Designer, a drag-and-drop editor for business analysts to designs the user experiences and interactivity for their multi-platform apps in a visual way.
  </p>

  <h3>The Library</h3>
  <p>
    I had used many canvas-based UI designers before, but not one allowing for the high level of configurability needed for Innovation Suite. A central challenge was deciding how to expose the properties and options in a clear way that did not require deep technical knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below are a handful of the library components in the first release of Innovation Suite, and their properties. Along the way, I also proposed an actions framework to enable complex interactions between components.
  </p>

  <h3>Tying it All Together</h3>
  <p>
    I had to zoom out a level and think about how the View Designer fit into an end-to-end user experience for designing, configuring, and launching apps to the BMC Marketplace. I worked with another designer to connect all the designer interfaces together and allow Business Analysts and Developers to work together on various pieces of their Smart Apps within Innovation Suite.
  </p>

  <h3>Support Mobile Platforms</h3>
  <p>
    I also needed to think about the best ways to support multi-platform apps that present equivalent experiences across Web and mobile phones and tablets. Customers loved the native iOS and Android experiences for Smart IT, so my mission was to work with the engineering team to allow Studio apps to support up to five platform targets.
  </p>
  <p>
    I recognized that having to design an app for multiple platforms would just multiply the required effort of the business analyst. So I instead devised a strategy to keep views in sync across all supported platforms and permit the business analyst to diverge selected views if they wished to implement a custom design for that part of the app on a mobile platform. This also allowed certain features to only be for Web or mobile. I also took all the default library components and designed mobile-specific versions that were then built as native iOS and Android code.
