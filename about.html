    I’m so happy that you have stumbled upon my little corner of the world. I’m Brian, a designer specializing in interactive products for the Web and mobile devices. I started out as a computer engineer at <a href="http://rpi.edu">RPI</a> but quickly recognized the power of design in applying technology to make amazing products that empower and delight people.

    I’m currently a UX Lead at <a class="underline" href="http://coupang.com">Coupang</a>, South Korea’s e-commerce giant. I’ve launched new enterprise apps at <a class="underline" href="http://bmc.com">BMC</a> and designed critical tools at <a class="underline" href="http://sandia.gov">Sandia National Laboratories</a>. I also build cool stuff in my spare time, like <a class="underline" href="/works/lotus">Lotus</a> and <a class="underline" href="/works/concerto2">Concerto</a>. I carve out product strategies based on user research, quickly prototype and iterate on new concepts, and work with engineers and product managers to realize complete and elegant user experiences.

    From learning new languages to jumping out of perfectly functional airplanes, I seek out adventures that expand my horizons and reveal creative opportunities. Every year, I plan an extended escapade to a new place and bring back photos and stories. I’m still just as madly in love with my home of San Francisco, California, as the first day I arrived.
