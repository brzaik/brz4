        I'm Brian, a product manager, designer, and leader. I was trained as a computer engineer at <a class="underline" href="http://rpi.edu">RPI</a> and quickly recognized the power of design in shaping technology into amazing products that empower and delight people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently a Senior Director of Product Management at <a class="underline" href="http://appdynamics.com">AppDynamics</a>. I've launched apps at <a class="underline" href="http://bmc.com">BMC</a> and designed critical tools at <a class="underline" href="http://coupang.com">Coupang</a> and <a class="underline" href="http://sandia.gov">Sandia National Laboratories</a>. I also build cool stuff in my spare time, like <a class="underline" href="/works/lotus">Lotus</a> and <a class="underline" href="/works/concerto2">Concerto</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had an unorthodox career trajectory spanning User Experience Design and Product Management. I've been both a people leader and an individual contributor. My perspective gives me superpowers to work across the “Golden Triangle” of successful products: Design, Engineering, and Program Management. I'm also really good at pitching ideas, aligning teams around shared visions, prototyping, and ruthlessly prioritizing to get things in front of users.
      </p>
      <p>
        From learning new languages to exploring the world, I seek out adventures that expand my horizons and reveal creative opportunities. I'm still just as in love with my home of California as the first day I arrived.
